# Face-Mask-Detection



  
## Description
We’re living in strange times at the moment. And it seems like wearing masks in public is becoming the norm. This application can be helpful for all the shop owners, offices, banks, or any public place because if anyone is not wearing a mask then he or she must not be allowed in that area. So, to take care of this problem we don’t need any guard or person who keeps a watch on people. We can integrate with CCTV and detect from their faces whether they are wearing a face mask or not.
The face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since the MobileNetV2 architecture is used, This system can be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to this situation.
Since this system is just a prototype, I have an idea to fix all the bugs and release it as an open-source complete face mask detector in the future.
